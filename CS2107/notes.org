** Why is security hard?
- Why can't we blame the developers?
  - Many developers lack the adversarial thinking to address potential problems during the development stage.

- The general flow has plaintext to cyphertext back to plaintext.
  - When evaluating the system, we assume that the cyphertext is known to any attackers
    - In general, we assume that the attacker can read all data sent accross the communication channel
  - Requirements:
    - Correctness
      - For any given plaintext, applying the encryption and decryption will result in the original plaintext
    - Security
      - An attacker will not be able to figure out the plaintext.
    - Performance
      - The encryption and decryption steps must be sufficently fast, and use sufficiently small keys and cyphertexts.

*** Attacking a Cipher
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       51F8780E-D175-4194-9C9B-803B07FB500B
:END:
- An attacker's goal is generally to find the key, in order to determine the plaintext
- It could also be simply to figure out some limited information about the plaintext.
- Generally, to commence an attack, an attacker would know some information about the cipher

**** Known Plaintext
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       51C901FF-09EA-40C6-AE8E-107F33D1D66D
:END:
- Some pairs of plaintext and its corresponding cyphertexts.
  - In many cases the attacker can guess at what the plaintext is depending on the context of the data (email headers, HTML headers, common words, etc.)
  - If a cipher can be broken when we have this information, we call it "insecure under known-plaintext attack" or "broken under known-plaintext attack".

**** Cyphertext Only
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       50B37D8A-18F7-49B5-B0D5-917D42BA7F02
:END:
- A large number of cyphertext all using the same key.
  - In some cases, especially with human languages, many substrings have much higher frequency in usage.
  - If a cipher can be broken when we have this information, we call it "not secure under cyphertext-only attack".
