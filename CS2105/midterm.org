RTFP

* Pitfalls
- READ IF IT'S BYTES OR BITS Uppercase B = Bytes, lowercase b = bits
- DHCP uses UDP
- Port numbers refer to processes, not hosts
- Port number + IP = socket
- SOCK_STREAM=TCP, SOCK_DGRAM=UDP
* Terms
- MSS (Maximum Segment Size) - The maximum data length of a TCP packet (not including headers)
- MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) - The maximum data length of a Data Link-level frame can carry
- RTT (Round trip timing) - Essentially the time it takes to send a negligible sized packet to the server and receive a reply
* TCP
- TCP has one timer
- Sequence number = next byte to be sent
- Sequence number goes up by one for handshake and teardown (SYN and FIN), as if they had a 1 byte payload
- ACK flag is set in almost all cases except for the first connection when there is nothing to ACKnowledge
* Checksums
- UDP:
  - Split into 16 bit words
  - Add one by one
  - Every time you get a carry from the MSB, move it to the LSB position and add it as well
  - Finally, take one's complement (invert all the bits)
