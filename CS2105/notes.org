* Internet
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3E696C35-46F4-4C10-98C9-584A8D60616C
:END:

- Internet is made up of routers
  - Data packets are sent through the network from source to destination

** Data Transmission
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       A6B358C8-8DF4-4D6D-84C3-E91031768743
:END:
- Packet switching
  - Users under the same router share its resources
  - Resources are not reserved, used on demand
    - A result of this is that packets may take different paths
    - Congestion is possible
  - Bits sent over a link which represent packets
    - Timing is a product of maximum bandwidth and propagation delay
  - Routers implement store and forward
    - Entire packet must reach the router before it will forward to the next stop in the network
    - This adds additional delay to the transmission
    - This is for the purpose for:
      - Integrity Checks

** Network Conditions

*** Packet Loss
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1D1E365F-4870-4C9D-ADE5-054FF94FA514
:END:
- Packet loss may occur when the router's buffer is full
- Connectivity issues may occur (both wired and wireless)
- Signal noise may result in corrupted packets

*** Packet Delay
:PROPERTIES:

**** Processing Delay
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       83010D99-9421-44DC-B1B7-9350ED7945B6
:END:
- Generally ignored
- How long it takes to process the packet (check for integrity, determine what to do with the packet)

**** Queueing Delay
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8AA81F32-434F-47F8-BE09-B6162306640D
:END:
- Generally ignored
- Time taken waiting for the router to finish processing packets that arrived before

**** Transmission Delay
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8C08E406-EC45-4D89-BF95-FE4A5A5505FE
:END:
- Limited by bandwidth of the connection
- "How long do I have to wait before can I send the next bit?"
- $\frac{\text{bits per time}}{\text{number of bits}}$

**** Propagation Delay
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5AA300BB-EFBE-4AAF-BBD3-1550EA76D34B
:END:
- Limited by the speed of the signal along the connection.
- "How long does it take for the data to go from point A to point B"?
- $\frac{\text{length of connection}}{\text{speed of data through connection}}$
