- One interpretation of [[id:7b143707-19ff-4cb9-95a5-c3ad210297d8][Probability]]
- Repeat an experiment E $n$ times
- Let the event A occur $n_A$ times
- The relative frequency $f_A$ of an event A is equal to $\frac{n_A}{n}$
- When n approaches infinity, the relative frequency approaches $P(A)$
- Properties of $f_A$
  - $0 \leq f_A \leq 1$
  - $f_A = 1$ if A occurs in every repetition
  - If A and B are mutually exclusive then $f_{A\cup B} = f_A + f_B$

- Let the sample space be $S = {a_1, a_2, ..., a_k}$
- Assume that $P(a_1) = P(a_2) = ... = P(a_k)$
- Then $P(A)$ = $\frac{\text{Number of sample points in A}}{\text{Number of sample points in S}}$
