* What I wish I knew...
- [[id:B3B21EA8-AA57-4AF7-A257-4780D20F55E9][Hong Yi]]
  - "Your intelligence as an engineer is important, but secondary to your communication skills"
    - Lack of communication leads to poor teamwork
    - Inner- and Inter- team communcation
- [[id:67129A67-DD2D-4E20-924E-811104881EE2][Faisal]]
  - Don't give up, prepare again
  - Don't be afraid to be the first to present the idea
    - Use and abuse resources
  - Spend time networking, even with people outside your direct expertise
  - Talking to people gives you a natural boost in value
- [[id:5DC105A8-1605-46CB-9F92-351EF1156E2A][Stephen]]
  - Do not be discouraged by the marathon
  - Being rejected does not necessitate a failure on your part, just not a good fit
  - Large organizations: specialists
    - Show a passion for the skillset they are looking for
  - Startups: generalist
    - Multiple interviews to ensure a personal fit
    - Display a large amount of skills
    - Show a passion for the field or the product
    - Learn about the startup
  - Many times a question is asked to gain insight into your thinking process, not about the answer's correctness.
- [[id:8307DFFD-D2A0-43E6-BA4F-88B3A6266BA3][Lei Lei]]
  - Some companies are willing to take someone with a knowledge deficit paired with a willingness to learn
- [[id:493C47CA-7B04-43CD-AD9B-9C42FF18C52A][San]]
  - Don't compromise with yourself
    - "It's not your job to say no to yourself"
  - You will always be "underqualified" because companies require you to be overqualified
  - Never too early to apply for internships
  - Take any internship that you can
  - Improve in as many aspects as you can.
    - Technical skills are not the end-all-be-all

* Insights into the Field

** Management
- The machine does not care about your engineering practices
- Being a good engineer is about empathy for other engineers and what they want in developing a system.
- As a manager/system engineer, being able to figure out what the best practices to use in a certain context is essential to having a team run efficiently

** Breadth vs Depth
- Undergrads don't know shit
- You do not know that you like something until you have to do it against your will
- In fact, screw your generalist studies too.
  - Do what you enjoy so that you can demonstrate passion
  - Specialization comes later
- In fact, screw your ideas of definitions too.
  - Things aren't well defined, don't rely on black-and white breakdowns to make your decisions.

* Lessons Learned
- It is your responsibility to make other people understand you
- The worst mistake of your life is an opportunity for reflection, not for sharing
- Interest isn't enough, you need passion in users
  - Passion from yourself is necessary
- Sometimes pidgeon complaints will be your first customer
  - Take all the customers you can get
- Things do not change by themselves
