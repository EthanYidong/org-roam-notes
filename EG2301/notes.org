* Translating Technology Advancements to Benefits

:END:
- Process to value creation
  - What are the step changes in the technology in the domain?
  - What is the important performance factor?
  - For each step change, what undesireable state (possibly an unarticulated problem or latent need) could be alleviated from the previous state?
  - What was the exponential benefit derived?
- MP3 player case study:
  - MP3 was a patented technology which eared money by licensing it to companies who wanted to build their own devices
  - The iPod was introduced in 2001
  - What did the iPod actually provide, and what was the value proposition?
  - Actually, how is Apple successful at all considering they are never first to the market?
  - The pitch was "1000 songs in your pocket", for the iPod's higher storage
  - MP3 players before the iPod didn't have that much more capacity
    - The main selling point used was the ability to pick songs digitally
  - Each step change (8 track to vinyl to cassettes (Walkman by Sony) to CDs to MP3s (iPod) to streaming) is associated with an iconic product
    - The new product adds capabilities not seen before, but also creates new problems to be solved

:END:
- Validating your thesis
  - In each technology step change, there is a problem or latent need worth solving. We call this the undesirable effect (UdE). What is the key UdE for the problem space?
  - Do you know what the future desireable effect looks like?
  - Where does you technology fit in the solution space of the future desired effect?

  - [[file:media/current-reality-tree-example_1.png][Current Reality Tree Example]]
  - The undesired effect is observable
  - Problems can cause others, be hidden or observed, negative feedback loops
  - Sometimes causes may be products of design decisions in previous technological step
    - For example, the MP3 player was forced to be small because the primary innovation of cassette players was to be a small device
  - Questions to ask:
    - What UdE are you targeting?
    - Which problem are you solving?
    - Does you technology solve this?
    - Will solving this problem achieve the desired effect?

- [[file:media/future-reality-tree-example_1.png][Future Reality Tree Example]]
- Questions to ask:
  - How can you change the undesirable effects to a Desired Outcome?
  - Identify where you can inject a better solution
  - Would the sum total of the injections create the desired outcome?
  - If not, you may have to add new injections.

- Objectives:
  - Profitability
  - Competitive offense/deterrence/response
  - Market penetration
  - Economic factors
  - Regulatory factors
  - Branding/Market Positioning
  - Change buyers' behavior
- Case Study
  - 2005
  - Fitness club in china
  - Price war between them and competitors
  - Idea was to become the monopoly
  - Location-based business
  - Nearby clubs dropped price below profit level to force the weakest player out of business
    - Starve competitors
  - Rebranded, raised price
  - "Blue ocean strategy"
    - Differenciate from competitors while dropping costs
- Common strategies
  - Cost plus pricing
    - Pricing = cost + desired profit
    - Simple, consistent returns
    - May not be competitive, lacks the incentive to operate efficiently
  - Penetration pricing
    - Special low price at first attract customers to try a new product
    - Low entry costs
    - Can double as marketing, and leads to accelerated early adoption
    - Encourages consumers to discontinue with your services once the special pricing expires
  - Value-based pricing
    - Pricing = how much the customer will pay
    - Very dependent on brand image, companies with brands perceived as valuable will gain more profits
  - Competition pricing
    - Product pricing is based around competitor pricing
    - Decide whether or not to price less than, equal to, or slightly more than competitors
  - Skimming pricing
    - Enter the market at high prices, then lower as competitors enter
  - Product line pricing
    - Having different models with variations, and pricing the different models to reach different subsegments
    - Gives more choices for little cost
