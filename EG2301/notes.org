* Value Proposition Canvas

- https://youtu.be/ReM1uqmVfP0
- A tool to visualize, design, and test how you create value for customers
- Two parts: customer profile, value map
- Customer profile
  - What job does your customer want to get done
    - Functional
    - Social
    - Emotional
  - Highlight the pains existing in the jobs
  - Demonstrate the gains that may be achieved by using your product
- Value map
  - List the products and services
  - How do these reduce or eliminate pain?
  - How do these produce gain?
- Make a clear connection between your customer profile and your value map

* Translating Technology Advancements to Benefits
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b75b809b-de84-4e41-ad4a-7d752214d005
:END:
- Process to value creation
  - What are the step changes in the technology in the domain?
  - What is the important performance factor?
  - For each step change, what undesireable state (possibly an unarticulated problem or latent need) could be alleviated from the previous state?
  - What was the exponential benefit derived?
- MP3 player case study:
  - MP3 was a patented technology which eared money by licensing it to companies who wanted to build their own devices
  - The iPod was introduced in 2001
  - What did the iPod actually provide, and what was the value proposition?
  - Actually, how is Apple successful at all considering they are never first to the market?
  - The pitch was "1000 songs in your pocket", for the iPod's higher storage
  - MP3 players before the iPod didn't have that much more capacity
    - The main selling point used was the ability to pick songs digitally
  - Each step change (8 track to vinyl to cassettes (Walkman by Sony) to CDs to MP3s (iPod) to streaming) is associated with an iconic product
    - The new product adds capabilities not seen before, but also creates new problems to be solved
* Problem Context of Opportunity â€” Current vs Future Reality
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2b1c1bbd-d642-4c07-927d-81a17db3f8e4
:END:
- Validating your thesis
  - In each technology step change, there is a problem or latent need worth solving. We call this the undesirable effect (UdE). What is the key UdE for the problem space?
  - Do you know what the future desireable effect looks like?
  - Where does you technology fit in the solution space of the future desired effect?
** Current Reality Tree

  - [[file:media/current-reality-tree_1.png][Current Reality Tree]]
  - [[file:media/current-reality-tree-example_1.png][Current Reality Tree Example]]
  - The undesired effect is observable
  - Problems can cause others, be hidden or observed, negative feedback loops
  - Sometimes causes may be products of design decisions in previous technological step
    - For example, the MP3 player was forced to be small because the primary innovation of cassette players was to be a small device
  - Questions to ask:
    - What UdE are you targeting?
    - Which problem are you solving?
    - Does you technology solve this?
    - Will solving this problem achieve the desired effect?
** Future Reality Tree
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- [[file:media/future-reality-tree_1.png][Future Reality Tree]]
- [[file:media/future-reality-tree-example_1.png][Future Reality Tree Example]]
- Questions to ask:
  - How can you change the undesirable effects to a Desired Outcome?
  - Identify where you can inject a better solution
  - Would the sum total of the injections create the desired outcome?
  - If not, you may have to add new injections.

* Expectancy Theory

:END:
- Or, "The Philosophy of Shocking Dogs"
- Seligman showed that dogs (people) conditioned to think that their actions cannot help their situation (learned helplessness)
- Creating expectations that your work and actions can lead to desireable outcomes will help to motivate you to continue to work

* Value Proposition (circa 2000s)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c000ef6f-c766-47d2-ba11-1375ed1b84dd
:END:
- Value
  - There is a "fair return" for the money
  - There is a need, utility, and importance
  - There is a desire to own or use
  - There is a benefit to the user or payer or beneficiary
- Proposition
  - The product is offered for consideration
  - What is being offered is true as claimed
- Should be:
  - Targeted
  - Authentic
  - Differentiated
  - Needs focused
  - Benefits articulate
  - Realizable by customers
- Should answer:
  - Who are the intended customers?
  - What do we want these customers to do?
  - What compelling alternatives do they have?
  - What resulting experiences/benefits will they derive, vs alternatives, if they do as we propose?
